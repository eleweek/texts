# Why stackoverflow is broken (for beginers) and what we can do about it

This week there is a lot of [drama](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3a0bit/announcement_experimenting_with_disabled_downvotes/) going on in /r/learnprogramming . During the last few months I've been thinking a lot about how people learn programming and what we can do to help people learn. I decided ~~to add fuel to the fire.~~ write down my thoughts on the topic. I have been thinking about it throught the last few months, and what follows is just the dump of my current thoughts. This isn't The Ultimate Truth.

* Mental models

When programmers write code, they create a model of how their code is supposed to behave. When their code doesn't behave as expected, they inevitably conclude that something is wrong with the code. So they fix the code. They don't fix their model. Software is soft after all.

For some reason programmers tend to apply the same line of thinking towards reality. They have a model of how reality is supposed to behave. When people don't behave the way they expect, they conclude that something is wrong with people. So they write posts like that[link] trying to fix people. But reality is "hard": humans are wired in a certain way.

If reality doesn't behave according to your model, you should fix your model.

* Stackoverflow

[Stack overflow is great because you can google a bunch of keywords and get stackoverflow link as a top result.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3a3o56/regarding_the_recent_discussion_about/) OP of this post also argues that to keep its greatness stackoverflow has to close and downvote open-ended and duplicating questions. You know what? I agree 100% with OP.

However, what OP fails to realize is that no one complains because they can't find an answer on StackOverflow. People complain because they ask questions and get downvoted to oblivion.

What OP fails to acknowledge is that Stackoverflow is a wrong tool for beginners. Instead, he implies that SO is *THE* right tool for questions, and that people should behave in a certain way.

* Context or why stackoverflow is broken for beginners

The real reason beginners can't "just google" answers is because they lack context. And it is not just a few keywords. To ask a proper stackoverflow question you need a lot of context. Compare "I don't understand why my python web app doesn't work" vs "Using this variable when rendering the template raises a weird exception". To properly formulate the second question you need to understand what is "rendering a template" and "raising an exception". In addition, You also need to understand what is a web server, what is an HTTP request, and quite a lot of other stuff.

(And as a side note, if you want to feel like a beginner, go learn some haskell while using stackoverflow).

* Anti-Stackoverflow

Experienced programmers didn't build the context magically by spending a couple of hours googling things. It was a gradual process that took a few months/years. 90% of beginners aren't lazy, they just lack context. Learning is hard sometimes, and beginners want to ask open-ended and seemingly duplicate questions. I think we should let them.

This would be the exact opposite of what Stackoverflow does. If existing tools don't work, maybe we could build an "Anti-Stackoverflow" then. How would a real-world "Anti-Stackoverflow" look like? While I have my own thoughts(and a cool experiment in my TODO list), I'm deliberately leaving this question open.
